- collate tiles
- fit star amp separately on each tile and save or make
  code aware somehow
- maybe try using gmms from hsc stars as a function of mag
    - below 19 can probably just git gmms directly to objects
    within some conc range
    - above use fits from hsc?


things I tried to make a bump at T=0
    - bad sky sub (at 0.1 noise level +/-)
    - cosmics
    - guessing near 0
    - no buffer region around image, so objects can be on the edge
    - single stamps with no offset
